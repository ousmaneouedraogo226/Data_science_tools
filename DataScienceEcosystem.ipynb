    "In this course you will be introduced to a Data Scientist's workbench or toolkit that consists of a variety of tools, languages, libraries, APIs, data sets, models, etc. used by Data Scientists. Try not to be overwhelmed by the sheer number of components and tools that exist in the Data Science ecosystem. The main goal of the course is for you to be knowledgeable about the kinds of tools Data Scientists use, their examples, and get some hands-on time with a few key tools. \n"
